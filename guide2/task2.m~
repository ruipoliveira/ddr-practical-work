%2a) For each value of p, determine the probability of the link being in the interference state
%and in the normal state when one control frame is received with errors (fulfil the
%following table). What do you conclude?

pAll = [0.99, 0.999, 0.9999, 0.99999]; 

pEF1 = 0;
pEF2 = 0;
pF1 = 0; 
pF2 = 0; 


%pF1E = (pEF1*pF1) / (pEF1*pF1 + pEF2*pF2)

results = [];
for i=1:size(pAll,2)
    results(i,1) = pAll(i) * 0.01;
    results(i,2) = pAll(i) ;
end
results
